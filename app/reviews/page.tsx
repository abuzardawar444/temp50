// The line const deleteReview = deleteReviewAction.bind(null, { reviewId }); uses the .bind() method to create a new function (deleteReview) with the this value (context) set to null and pre-defines the reviewId as the first argument to the deleteReviewAction function.

// Hereâ€™s how it works:

// Binding Arguments:

// deleteReviewAction.bind(null, { reviewId }) creates a new function (deleteReview) that, when called, will invoke deleteReviewAction with { reviewId } as its first argument.
// Executing on Button Click:

// The deleteReview function is passed to the FormContainer component as the action to be performed when the form is submitted (usually by clicking a button).
// When the button inside FormContainer is clicked, the form submission triggers the deleteReview function.
// In summary, .bind() allows you to set specific arguments for the function ahead of time. When the button is clicked, the pre-bound reviewId is passed into deleteReviewAction, triggering the deletion process.

// This approach is useful because it keeps your event handler simple and doesn't require passing arguments directly in the JSX, which can be a cleaner and more reusable pattern.
